To avoid conflict with NJPhA, he appointed Elise Barry & Laurie Clark to his board, and got the owners to use Laurie as their lobbyist and coordinate their activities. He also organized, in conjunction with NJPhA a day in the legislature for the owners, and solicited financial contributions to help fight for the PBM transparency bill. He also held a dinner for a newly elected Indo-American Assemblyman and is active in Monmouth County politics	\N

He took ownership of the Student Practitioner Committee newsletter and "founded" this important communicate tool which disseminates information to all NJPHA members about student activities and officer messages.  He worked tirelessly to develop a template for the newsletter and edited the first edition of the newsletter.   He networked with other NJPHA members and encouraged them to get involved with the student group.  Tim had a significant impact on my own participation in NJPHA.  Because of his collegiality and genuine personal demeanor, I was interested in joining the group to provide opportunities for students.  Tim was an outstanding role model.  He confidently ran the meetings, established charges, and effectively conducted Student Practitioner business.  I don't think I would have been interested in taking a leadership position unless Tim had showed me how to do it!  Most importantly, Tim works diligently to provide opportunities for his students.  It could be working with students on posters, publications, or on preparing for college competitions.  	\N

Have a positive effect on healthcare, reduce medication errors and increase medication compliance with patients.  In essence his purpose is to improve the lives of the people within the communities he serves and advance the profession of pharmacy.  Ritesh is an example of a person with real compassion.  He sees a need and seeks to meet it.  Is has been over 12 years since I’ve worked in a pharmacy as a pharmacist and most would think the work Ritesh has done for pharmacists would just be impossible.  The way he looks at the world reminds me of something the great boxer Muhammad Ali said to skeptics.  “Impossible is just a big word thrown around by small men who find it easier to live in the world they've been given than to explore the power they have to change it. Impossible is not a fact. It's an opinion. Impossible is not a declaration. It's a dare. Impossible is potential. Impossible is temporary. Impossible is nothing.”  He has shown a willingness to collaborate an unparalleled dedication to his pharmacy community.  In his practice he has taken great strides to reduce medication error or rather increase medication safety and also in making it easier for people to adhere to their therapy.  I believe his efforts will save and improve the lives of many.\r\n \r\n	\N

Listening carefully to his patients and then consulting with their prescriber, Mark and his team can develop customized medication solutions that meet the health objectives of both people and pets. And while compounding pharmacy has had some unfortunate mishaps recently, Mark is committed to a standard of high quality. Employing state of the art equipment and testing, Jersey Shore Pharmacy recently attained accreditation by the Pharmacy Compounding Accreditation Board (PCAB) for sterile and non-sterile compounding. PCAB accreditation gives patients, prescribers, and payers a way to select a pharmacy that meets or exceeds USP’s high quality standards. They are one of only eight pharmacies in New Jersey that are PCAB accredited.  Professionally, Mark is a member of half a dozen pharmacy organizations as well as serving as Treasurer and Trustee for NJPhA Region 5.  He also serves as a preceptor for all the area pharmacy colleges. I recommend visiting the Jersey Shore Pharmacy website at http://www.jspharmacy.com/ for a truly impressive list of accomplishments and ways in which Mark's team is serving their patients. 	\N

In addition to developing a Pharmacy Residency Program (PGY-1) at Capital Health in 2011, Chester developed and initiated the Mini-Residency (Knights Scholar) program with Rutgers University, EMSOP in 2014 which now expands to 3 NJ hospitals in 2015.  The program began 1/2014 with 4 students participating from 5/2014 to 12/2014. St. Barnabas and Hunterdon Hospitals have decided to implement the program at their hospitals.  There will be 9 Knight Scholars participating in the program for 2015 (4 at Capital Health, 3 at Barnabas and 2 at Hunterdon).   \r\nThe intent of the program is to develop scholarship, service, and leadership in motivated PharmD candidates through a diversified block of advanced pharmacy practice experiences (APPE) in a health-system environment.  Upon completion of the program, the KNIGHT ScholarRx student will have gained: (1) knowledge and skills necessary to function as an active member of the healthcare team; (2) a network of preceptors, practitioners and P4 students who can support his/her student and professional career; (3) innovative experiences that will prepare him/her for success in a postgraduate training program.  In addition to their standard APPE rotation requirements, the scholars, at a minimum, will complete a research project (publication or presentation) – IRB process, good clinical practice guidelines, and the Collaborative Institutional Training Initiative (CITI); participate in a community project in collaboration with other KNIGHT ScholaRx students; present one formal patient case, journal club, and drug information activity during each clinical APPE.\r\nEach KNIGHT ScholaRx is scheduled to complete 4 X 5 week blocks out of their APPE blocks covering internal medicine, infectious disease, critical care and hospital practice.  Their patient care roles include discharge counseling, medication reconciliation, antimicrobial stewardship (IV to PO, kinetic monitoring) and target drug monitoring.\r\nChester has also initiated an annual  meeting  for residents to present their research projects prior to the Eastern State Conference held each year in May.  The purpose is for the residents to practice their presentations prior to the conference and also to showcase their talents.  The invitation is sent to area DOP’s with residency programs.\r\nIt is of my opinion this program enhances the training and practice experience of the students which will enhance patient care.  The data from their interventions supports improving quality of care of the patient and their outcomes.  Chester is very committed to developing our young practitioners to focus on the care our patients receive.\r\nSandra Moore, PharmD\r\nCV for Chester Lau is attached\r\n	\N

Maria is a leader on the St. Johns campus and worked with the students to found the NJPhA student chapter.  She is an advisor to the NJPhA chapter and involves her students in activities. We worked collaboratively to coordinate events at the 2013 annual convention in Atlantic City and also the 2014 annual convention in Asbury Park.  In 2013, Maria and I worked together to develop a student round-table activity.  This was a successful event and was attended by almost 50 students.  She developed an idea for the 2014 activity that would involve pharmacy students working together in teams to market their pharmacy service.  She shared her innovative ideas to create an event that promoted awareness to promote your pharmacy service to other professionals including physicians, nurses, and nurse-practitioners.  The event was a success as students from Rutgers, Phila College of Pharmacy and Long Island University were assigned to work in intercollegiate teams.  In observing the students, they had time to work on the project and share their experiences with their curriculum and post-career plans.  The event resulted in the development of table-talk posters where students shared their creative services to promote effective and safe medication use.  Maria worked collegially with the members of the student practitioner committee, encouraged students to submit to the newsletter, and is a strong advocate for students and NJPhA.	\N

Upon her retirement she approached the officials of the Board of Health  in the Township of Hanover ( her home municipality)  to ask if she could begin a Pharmacy Brown Bag Program serving the needs of the community. . The program was then initiated  in  2014 , sponsored by the Health Department and  directed by Marlene.\r\n\r\nEach session is held on a 1 to 1 basis and lasts 45 minutes.  Marlene has been responsible, through the program, for creating an awareness in the community for each individual  regarding the understanding of their drug regimen, side effects, interactions  and proper timing and disposal of medications. The patients are free to address their questions and concerns about their medications to Marlene, too.\r\n\r\nThe community has benefited from this program, since in many cases, their dispensing pharmacist often does not have the time to counsel.  This has been a tremendous success in Hanover, especially with the senior citizen population who represent the majority of polypharmacy patients.\r\n\r\nMarlene has adopted the same program in Morris Township.  She has seen over 40 patients in the past 2 years. She also addressed town senior citizen groups on the topics of Drug Safety and Proper Disposal.\r\n\r\nSubsequently she has been appointed the the Board of Health in Hanover Township in 2016, again serving the community in a monumental way.\r\n\r\nMarlene has given of herself in all aspects of these activities while, at the same time, using her professional pharmacy knowledge to 'give back', never accepting any remuneration.  \r\n\r\nThe facts support her consideration for the William H.

We all know that only a very small minority of pharmacists in the State are doing all the work for the majority and that we all have to multitask and do the job of many. Donna Cestone exemplifies this commitment to pharmacy as is evidenced by the body of work listed in the enclosed Biosketch. I have worked with her extensively on professional matters. Donna has always encouraged me to participate in the Association and has been an invaluable resource to the Committees I have chaired, particularly in Regionalization which she committed her Presidency to, and is now serving the association so well today.  For over 25 years Donna has continually used her experience in the industry, community, managed care, clinical pharmacy and government to promote the profession and practice of pharmacy. Of the approximately 10,000 pharmacists licensed in New Jersey it would be hard to find one with such a diverse and distinguished background and one who has selflessly put her skills to use for the profession and the community we serve.	\N

The proper etiquette of policy is not an easy task especially when it comes to teaching over 100 pharmacy students within a limited amount of time, but Dr. Brickman handled the task like a professional. Her advocacy and love for pharmacy is easy to see when talking with her. Her stance is very strong willed and she would do anything for her students to have a successful future, especially when it comes to proper reimbursement from the government for Medicaid. Witnessing this first hand as one of her students was very inspiring. Not only has she been a role model politically in the pharmacy world, but she has been the most devoted adviser for the NJPhA chapter of Temple University School of Pharmacy. As a chapter, we were able to accomplish a lot of community service events which has lead this group to become one of the most active within the campus community. Without the guidance of Dr. Brickman, our organization would not have been as successful as it has been within these past few years.

He is a tenacious public defender, striving to maintain the highest practice standards in order to protect public health and safety. \r\n\r\nMr. Bender has been a member of New Jersey Board of Pharmacy for over 20 years, and currently is serving as the President of the Board.  In addition, Mr. Bender has been an Expert Committee member at USP, and a Task Force committee member as well as the Chairman Committee on resolutions at NABP.  Mr. Bender has received numerous recognitions throughout his profession and is a well-regarded individual in the health care arena. \r\n\r\nTom and I have been working closely at the NJ State Board after the tragic New England Compounding Center meningitis outbreak. He was part of the leadership in the Board revision of the state compounding regulations and collaborated closely with the FDA and the CDC.  He dedicated his time and efforts to safeguard the patient’s health and safety not only in our home state, but set a great example leading other states as well. Today, I can assure you, as a NABP consultant, as well as a Public Servant myself, the pharmacy practice in New Jersey is a much safer place than it was before. \r\nIt is my honor to nominate Thomas Bender Jr, to be considered as the recipient of the Bowel of Hygeia this year. \r\n\r\nSincerely yours, \r\nTony H. Qi\r\n	\N

Clark – Legislative Counsel\r\n\r\nAssemblyman Raj Mukherji (D) has represented the 33rd Legislative District since the year 2014.\r\nDespite the fact that he is one of the youngest members of the Legislature, his achievements are truly outstanding.   In terms of his importance to the profession of pharmacy, he is a member of the following committees:\r\n•\tAssembly Budget Committee\r\n•\tAssembly Commerce and Economic Development Committee\r\n•\tAssembly Labor Committee\r\nI have nominated him for this award because of his outstanding legislative record but most importantly for his work on the PBM Regulation Issues through sponsorship of the MAC Transparency Law, P.L. 2015, Chapter 179.  This law went into effect in April of 2016, and provided for the very first time that PBMs were placed under the jurisdiction of the New Jersey Department of Banking and Insurance. \r\nIn the current legislative session, he is the Co-Prime Sponsor of A-4676, entitled the “Prescription Drug Patient Protection Act” which will further regulate PBMS by  providing a solid regulatory structure for consumer protection under the Department of Banking and Insurance, and Prime Sponsor of A-5041 which prohibits a PBM from retroactively  deducting money on a clean claim either directly or indirectly on any pharmacy claim processed in this state effectively preventing any DIR type fees from being implemented in our state.\r\nThe Assemblyman is steadfastly committed to advancing the profession of pharmacy and to ensuring that PBMs are thoroughly regulated in New Jersey.    We are extremely fortunate to have an individual of his capabilities as a strong supporter.\r\nLink to official biography: http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/members/BIO.asp?Leg=364\r\nI have also attached a narrative biography. \r\n	\N

This bill allows for the substitution of these products by pharmacists, provided the conditions set forth in the bill are met.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, the bill directs the Commissioner of Health to maintain, and make available to each pharmacy practice site in the State without charge, a list of biosimilar biological products approved by the FDA to be interchangeable with a prescribed biological reference product. A pharmacist may substitute such a product for a prescribed biological product if the prescriber has not indicated that there be no substitution by initialing the prescription blank next to &ldquo;do not substitute. A pharmacist who dispenses an interchangeable biosimilar product is to notify the patient in writing that the dispensed biological product has been approved by the FDA as an interchangeable biosimilar biological product, and notify the prescribing practitioner of the substitution within five business days after dispensing. The pharmacist is to record, on the prescription label and dispensing record, the product name of the interchangeable biosimilar biological product, followed by the words: &ldquo;Substituted for&rdquo; and the name of the biological reference product for which the prescription was written, as well as the manufacturer of the interchangeable biosimilar biological product. Records of substitutions are to be maintained for at least five years after the dispensing date.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The bill provides immunity from liability for a pharmacist who makes such substitutions in compliance with the bill to the same extent that immunity would be provided for dispensing the prescribed biological reference product. The bill incorporates the definitions used in relevant federal law for the terms &ldquo;biological product,&rdquo; &ldquo;biosimilar,&rdquo; &ldquo;biological reference product,&rdquo; and &ldquo;interchangeable.&rdquo; Generally, &ldquo;biological products&rdquo; are made from various sources, including human, animal or microorganism, and are intended to treat medical conditions, or prevent or diagnose diseases. &ldquo;Biosimilar&rdquo; means that data show that a product is &ldquo;highly similar&rdquo; to an already-approved biological product. &ldquo;Reference product&rdquo; refers to the single biological product against which a biological product is evaluated in an application to be licensed as biosimilar or interchangeable. The bill also amends the definitions of &ldquo;drug&rdquo; in R.S.24:1-1 and &ldquo;drug product&rdquo; in section 5 of P.L.1977, c.240 (C.24:6E-4) to clarify that those terms do not include &ldquo;biological product.&rdquo; The bill takes effect on the first day of the second month next following the date of enactment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>{% endsliding_div %}</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n	30	2014-04-10 15:11:53.545875	2016-08-19 16:39:31.183628	2	t	t	f		f	f	Pharmacy Advocacy & Legislation	f

When the page opens, click the Global ebilling link in the upper left corner of the screen to access your ebilling&nbsp;account.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And good news... NJPhA has activated Card Vault. By storing credit card information on our secure server, you can now renew your membership, and register for events, on the fly!&nbsp;Check out the new Card Vault option on the payment processing page when you click online to pay your invoice. You can even select an automatic renewal option so that your membership is paid on time, in full at each renewal.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Lapsed membership?</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Members who wish to update their memberships&nbsp;after a lapsed period are, once again, encouraged to call the NJPhA office. Alternatively, you can <a href="http://www.njpharmacists.org/membership/become-a-member">complete a new member registration online</a>. &nbsp;But take special note that&nbsp;all newly-inputted information will overwrite the previously-stored information in your membership profile.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n	5	2017-01-05 18:14:22.321942	2017-03-08 20:04:44.958482	3	t	t	f		f	f		f
